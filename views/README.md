# Build a website with Ruby and JavaScript

## Why am I doing this?
You can already get a pretty long way building a website using just HTML & CSS.  Or perhaps instead using the myriad blogging engines and 'build a website' services that exist.  So why bother with Ruby?

The truth is, being a web developer is not really about HTML and CSS.  Those are only a small part of the very broad range of skills and languages that a good developer needs to have.  Plus, only a proportion of web development actually happens on the web.  For the most part, developers work with code in 'development environments' on their local machines; very far from all the bells and whistles.

Being a web developer is about leveraging a whole range of technologies and languages, often at quite low levels and being confident to dive in and learn something new - and potentially complicated - even if it's initially bewildering.

And that's what this project is for: to give you a peek under the hood and hopefully - depending on your experience - challenge you to get a bit out of your depth.

So, let's begin.

## How to follow this guide
There are no intentional tricks or traps in this guide.  If you follow the instructions correctly, you should finish with a fully-working website that can be deployed to the world.  If you get stuck, read [what to do if you get stuck](#what-to-do-if-you-get-stuck).  There are only two rules:

* **Type every line of code yourself**.  While it's tempting to copy and paste code from this guide, you won't learn anything if you do.
* **You don't need to understand everything**.  Of course, 'understanding' is a vital part of being a developer; but so is managing how much you need to know.  It isn't possible to understand everything.

## What to do if you get stuck
Getting stuck sucks.  Especially when you're just getting started and things don't work!

But don't worry - getting stuck is an inevitable part of being a developer and getting unstuck is a critical skill.  If you are not getting the results you expect, try the following steps:
